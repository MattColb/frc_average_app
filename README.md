# frc_average_app

This is an app that I built to calculate the average scores of teams in the First Robotics Competition.
I made this using TheBlueAlliance API (Documentation here: https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs)

I was head drive coach and team captain for team 5041, and I knew a lot of teams from my experience.
The rest of the team was pretty young, so I wanted to make something to help them out in competitions.

The current app is just a python program but I plan to add more up until the 2023 season.
Here are just some of the things that I hope to add:
- Average points scored against
- How accurate can the averages predict at a certain competition
- A web app using flask

The program has some comments about how the code works, as well as how to use it, and which parts to change to get different results.

Hopefully this is helpful.

Enjoy
